#FORGED CHEQUE DETECTOR


This project focuses on simplifying the detection of forged and authentic bank cheques by leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning algorithms.


Image Preprocessing: The initial step involves preprocessing the cheque images to eliminate noise and irrelevant details. Techniques such as Gaussian blur are employed to enhance image quality.


Text Extraction: After preprocessing, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is applied to extract printed text from the cheque. For handwritten text, specialized datasets are used to ensure accurate recognition.
Signature Verification: The Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm is utilized to extract features from signatures. These features are then verified using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to ensure authenticity.


Overall Process: This comprehensive approach provides a robust method for distinguishing forged cheques from genuine ones, enhancing the reliability and security of cheque verification.
This project represents a significant step towards automated, reliable cheque verification, combining multiple cutting-edge technologies to achieve high accuracy in fraud detection.
